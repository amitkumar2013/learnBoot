Trigger a build using the following

> .git/hooks/post-commit

#!/bin/sh
echo "executing post-commit"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/job/SpringBootJob/build?delay=0sec --user <jenkins-user>:<jenkins-pswd>
exit 0

This is better as it does not require any user authentication

#!/bin/sh
echo "executing post-commit"
curl http://localhost:8080/git/notifyCommit?url=file://c:/javaProj/gs-spring-boot
exit 0
